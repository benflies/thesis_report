\section{Results}\label{Sec:Results}

\begin{itemize}

\item Organize material and present results.

\item Use tables, figures (but prefer visual presentation):
\begin{itemize}
\item Tables and figures should supplement (and not duplicate) the
text.

\item Tables and figures should be provided with
legends.\\
{\it Figure \ref{Fig:Resids} shows how to include and reference
graphics. The graphic must be labelled before. Files must be in
\texttt{.eps} format.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=0]{graph}
\caption{Estimated residuals from model XXX. ...}
\label{Fig:Resids}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item Tables and graphics may appear in the text or in
the appendix, especially if there are many simulation results
tabulated, but is also depends on the study and number of tables resp.
figures. The key graphs and tables must appear in
the text!
\end{itemize}

\item Latex is really good at rendering formulas:\\
{\it Equation (\ref{Eq:SpecDens}) represents the ACs of a stationary
stochastic process:
\begin{equation}
f_y(\lambda) = (2\pi)^{-1} \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}
\gamma_j e^{-i\lambda j}
=(2\pi)^{-1}\left(\gamma_0 + 2 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}
\gamma_j \cos(\lambda j)\right)
            \label{Eq:SpecDens}
\end{equation}
where $i=\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit, $\lambda \in [-\pi,
\pi]$ is the frequency and the $\gamma_j$ are the autocovariances
of $y_t$.}

\newpage

\item Discuss results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the results support or do they contradict economic theory ?
\item What does the reader learn from the results?
\item Try to give an intuition for your results.
\item Provide robustness checks.
\item Compare to previous research.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Samtools Flagstat command was used to determine some basic BAM statistics of BAM
files of samples prepared with the respective library preparations and processed with
the mentioned bioinformatic pipelines. \ref{table:samtools_flagstat} shows the
averaged result of these statistics. Considering the recommended pipelines, Haloplex
CSC data, analyzed with Agilent's SureCall software, has a higher percentage (91\%) of mapped
reads when compared to Illumina's BaseSpace TruSight Tumor 15 App (62.9\%). Data analysis
with the recommended SureCall design includes a steps where mates are fixed, but they
are not stitched together. Therefore no reads are considered as being paired. The TST15 app
in contrast includes a read stitching step and 58\% are considered as properly paired.
This means that of the 62.6\% of mapped reads, 4.2\% are not properly paired. 3.8\%
of reads processed with the TST15 online App are considered to be singletons, whereas
only 1.8\% of reads processed with the SureCall software are considered as singletons.
