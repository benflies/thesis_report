\subsection{Library Preparation}
\subsubsection{Patients}
Melanoma
Non-Small Cell Lun Carcinoma (NSCLC)
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were extracted from blood and did not undergo
FFPE treatment -> were used as some kind of good quality samples & to see if there
are really more C>T variants in FFPE samples.
